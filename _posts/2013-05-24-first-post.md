Welcome to my new & improved blog.  Now hosted via GitHub, backed by the power of a thousand octocats, I'm sure it will provide meaningful insights to all of the universe's problems.  Ok, maybe not.

On a more serious note, I do plan on posting around topics like data science with R, data crunching with frameworks like Spark, and probably a disproportionate amount of info on Legos.

Thanks for visiting!
